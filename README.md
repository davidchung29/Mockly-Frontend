# Mockly Frontend (Public Notice)

This repository previously contained the frontend code for Mockly â€” an AI-powered interview practice platform.

Due to ongoing product development and IP concerns, the source code is now private.

If you're a recruiter, hiring manager, or partner interested in learning more, reach out (dichung@andrew.cmu.edu) and I can share the repository.
The deployed website is available at: http://mockly.pro/
