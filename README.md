# Mockly Frontend

This repository previously contained the frontend code for **Mockly** â€” an AI-powered interview practice platform that helps users improve through real-time feedback on eye contact, vocal clarity, pacing, and more.

Due to ongoing product development and IP protection, the source code is now private.

ðŸš€ The live site is available at: [http://mockly.pro/](http://mockly.pro/)

ðŸ“¬ If you're a recruiter, hiring manager, or collaborator interested in learning more, feel free to reach out at **dichung@andrew.cmu.edu** â€” Iâ€™d be happy to provide access or a private walkthrough.
